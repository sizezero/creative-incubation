### Writing Effective Design Specs

* use specs to review and resolve conflicts
* How can we write specs to be as clear and effective as possible?

Designers are often really bad at writing clearly. Designers think
their work is perfect.

Good writing and good technical writing are not the same
thing. Interesting writing may get in the way of what you are trying
to communicate.

You are not your spec.

* your design is stupid
* it's obvious and trite

Get your ego out of the process. You have actually just created a
starting point of a conversation.

Specs are not arguments. Get some amount of by-in early.

It helps to think that your spec is crap, then you will be better able
to get constructive feedback and incorporate it into your bad
spec. Don't let your team on to this. It may look like false modesty.

two objectives
* technically correct
* easy to understand

be honest if the design is broken

lose an argument
