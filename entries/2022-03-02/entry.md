Two year's later I'm back at Dice Tower West.

### [Nidavellir](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/293014/nidavellir)

A fast little auction game where you get first choice in lots of
cards. You also upgrade your coins which are your bidding tokens. It
seems a bit like Ra but plays very differently. It is also somewhat
fiddly with a large assortment of bonus cards to buy but I think that
may make the game more strategic.

This definitely needs repeated plays before judging it. I'm not sure
if my group would like this game but I'd like to try it.

### [Regicide](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/307002/regicide)

A sweet little cooperative game that simulates a cooperative, raid,
boss fight and manages to do it with a normal deck of playing
cards. Very clever! It look like it's hard enough to warrant repeated
plays.

### [Space Base](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/242302/space-base)

Rolling dice, collecting money and buying cards that do more for you
for the next die roll. It has that die rolling excitment but there's
not a lot of deep thinking.

### [Fantasy Realms](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/223040/fantasy-realms)

Just barely a game. You draft the best hand of seven cards while
trying to keep other players from getting combos that are too
rediculous. This is too small and fast to ever hit the table in my
group.
