Two year's later I'm back at Dice Tower West.

## Wednesday

### [Nidavellir](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/293014/nidavellir)

A fast little auction game where you get first choice in lots of
cards. You also upgrade your coins which are your bidding tokens. It
seems a bit like Ra but plays very differently. It is also somewhat
fiddly with a large assortment of bonus cards to buy but I think that
may make the game more strategic.

This definitely needs repeated plays before judging it. I'm not sure
if my group would like this game but I'd like to try it.

### [Regicide](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/307002/regicide)

A sweet little cooperative game that simulates a cooperative, raid,
boss fight and manages to do it with a normal deck of playing
cards. Very clever! It look like it's hard enough to warrant repeated
plays.

### [Space Base](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/242302/space-base)

Rolling dice, collecting money and buying cards that do more for you
for the next die roll. It has that die rolling excitment but there's
not a lot of deep thinking. This would be a good last
everybody-is-drunk-and-we-want-one-more-play game, but I probably
don't want to own it.

### [Fantasy Realms](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/223040/fantasy-realms)

Just barely a game. You draft the best hand of seven cards while
trying to keep other players from getting combos that are too
rediculous. This is too small and fast to ever hit the table in my
group.

## Thursday

### [Ark Nova](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/342942/ark-nova)

I think the best way to describe this is a better Terraforming
Mars. There's a giant deck of cards with all kinds of hidden synergy
but there are many mechanisms to search and cycle them so it feels
that each player has some chance of getting a winnng strategy going.

The action cycling is interesting and simple. Your actions are scaled
based on how long it has been since you've played them so you are
encouraged to not spam actions. I still ended up spamming some actions
near the end of the game because the others had become useless.

Lot's of early unlocks to get more powerful actions. The card
synergies are mostly about victory points and income.

There's a lot of fiddling with a private tableau. I'm not a fan of
this. The tetris game of arranging your zoo didn't bother me much as
it was generally pretty easy to fill in locations.

Do I like this game? If I had a group that wanted to play the game a
lot and dig deeply into it, I might give it a shot. Bringing it to the
table occasionally, probably would not be fun.

Eric: The tableu was helpful by tyeing into the other cards e.g. some
animals needed to be next to be next to rocks, next to kiosk. Eric
like the aesthetic of making the zoo. Liked the thematic tie ins. This
could make the game enjoyable even if you don't win.

John: The tableu is important for the complexity. Imagine that wasn't
there and you just played cards. Something would be missing.

Eric: Five cards that got more powerful when you didn't used them
required doing a broad strategy. You suffered a bit by doing a single
strategy. Clearing the five slot was sometimes very important.

Robert: I think I misvalued the "move a five card to the one slot"
animal effect. Being able to clear a dud card from the five slot is
great.

### [Furnace](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/318084/furnace)

This is a quick game that has a very interesting bidding mechanc where
the winner gets a permanent ability and the losers get immediate
actions proportional to their bid. When you bid, it's not always clear
which ones you'll get.

It's so quick and fun that I'd like to get it just to see how good the
strategies/tactics can get in the game.

## Friday

### [Maricaibo](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/276025/maracaibo)

This was a super point-salady game with a ton of different
mechanisms. I fell behind early and ended up joining Eric's Spain
strategy which just secured his victory but me second place. I was
very frustrated not getting cards that allowed me to get
quests. Increasing my hand size didn't help. Eric said that he managed
quest requirements by purchasing cards from the tableau.

Others played this game a few times and noted that the many scoring
methods did not seem necessary to the game, in particular the
exploration track at the bottom of the board.

Chris: the area influence mechanic seemed to make it too easy for a
straggleer to piggy back onto someone who advanced the
nation. Suggested making a "first here" bonus to fix that. I'm not
sure more scoring patches would help.

### [Dodos Riding Dinos](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/254683/dodos-riding-dinos)

Mario Kart the board game. Not much to say about this. I bet a group
of young kids would have a blast with this.

There were a lot of extra boards that added more game effects. This
seemed unecessary to me as the game was already so random but maybe the
extra complexity is fun to some people?

### [Libertalia second edition](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/125618/libertalia)

The most interesting part of this game was the mechanic of taking a
large set of cards and giving each player a subset of them. The
subtlety of play was lost on me but the two other players had played
the game before and there was a lot of really intereting second
guessing.

There was a touch of hate in the game which I didn't like as well as a
tie breaking reputation track that felt clunky and unecessary. I don't
think I'd be interested in playing this game again but it would be
interesting to see anothr game that uses this "subset of a deck"
mechanic.

### [Cosmic Colonies](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/283095/cosmic-colonies)

This was a very light game where you collect resources and build a
tableu of tetris shapes on a private map. Obviously I hated the tetris
mechanic.

The new mechanic was that played cards pass to the next player
clockwise. This means any given game uses a very small set of
cards. I've complained about games that have huge decks and
insufficient searching so I am surprised that now I get to complain of
using such a small set of cards. The game felt very samey as we all
played similar cards over and over.

There's no reason to play this game again.

### [Dune Imperium with expansion](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/342031/dune-imperium-rise-ix)

IX technology tiles, dreadnaughts, a mess of new cards, and new CHOAM
action spaces. All the additions feel good although the increase deck
size might make for an even more random tableau as there is no good
card searching.

I won the game because I was the only one to unlock the CHOAM ability
early and then bought a third worker. This let me spam the powerful
ability with my normally dud, third worker.

## Saturday

### [Dune Imperium](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/316554/dune-imperium)

We played 1 1/2 games without the expansion. Not much new but I had an
interesting experience in the last game.

I got a bad start in the second game, got grumpy, and couldn't find a
good way out of it. Afterwards, I thought about how the game played
out and tried to see if there was some way I could have played
better. I realized that early in the game I had decided that I wanted
to try a deck building strategy for a bunch of reasons: my power gave
me a bonus for buying cards, I had ignored card buying in the previous
games, and I wanted to play with the new cards. When the player to my
right (Eric) beat me to the 2 bonus buy I should have given up on that
strategy as he was able to buy all the good cards before me. As a
result I found myself with 6 or 7 buy with nothing good to spend it
on. Sometimes I bought a lesser card instead of buying nothing just to
pretend I had agency but that was a bad decision since it just opened
up potentially better cards for other players. I guess the lesson is
to not be wedded to a strategy? Or maybe aware of possible changes to
the gamee state that would make you abandon your strategy.

Eric ended up building an amazing deck with some of the new cards,
built a big lead, but somehow ended up losing to the other player
(Wyatt). I'm not sure how that happened.

I also noticed that in this game the third worker seemed a little more
effective than it normally did. On reflrection I think it's because a
three player game has the same number of worker spaces as a four
player game thus there are usually better placement options. I talked
with Eric about this and he said he kind of likes it when games change
with the player count. I was reminded of the drastic difference in the
effectiveness of the Library card with different player counts in [San
Juan](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/8217/san-juan)

I think I really like this game. I wish my game group liked it
more. Maybe there's some way to get them to play faster to shorten the
length.

### [Everdell](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/199792/everdell)

We had a group of four, really good gamers and we couldn't think of
anything to play. I really should have done my homework and made a
list of new games I wanted to play. I'm not sure why, but we decided
to play Everdell. Eric and I had played it years ago and were not
impressed.

Nothing to say here except two things.

- We had an alpha gamer in our group who grokked the game much better
  than the rest of us and devastated us.

- The game is, amazingly, listed as a family game despite its
  complexity.

- I couldn't help but wonder if the cutesy nature of this game could
  bring some players towards complex gaming. Maybe you could play and
  have fun with the beautiful tree, build random cards, and slowly
  learn the game?

Future self: do not play this game again. I repeat: DO NOT PLAY THIS
GAME AGAIN!

### [Regicide](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/307002/regicide)

Another fun play. It improved the second play as I saw a bit more of
the depth, looking at all the players hands counts and considering how
my actions would affect them. The end came quick like a guiotine which
was nice, not long and drawn out.

### [Shipwreck Arcana](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/220517/shipwreck-arcana)

Sure, I don't like deduction games but this one is fairly constrained
and short, so you'd think I could enjoy it a little. I don't know if
I'm just terrible at deduction or if I just don't have fun make my
brain do it. Probably a combination of the two.

### [Furnace](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/318084/furnace)

We played our first game with the special powers and the concensus was
that it didn't help the game at all. The powers felt a little
unbalanced but, more importantly, they really threw the bidding out of
whack. It was much more difficult to guess what each player may have
wanted.

I won the game but I got really felt lucky in that I overproduced iron
in the first round and in the second round there were a ton of spots
available for converting consolation iron to something else. Since no
one else had iron I was like a kid in a candy store. I'm hoping that
since this is such a short game, that lucky breaks like this won't
ruin the experience.

Eric gave me the game afterwards. Thanks Eric!
