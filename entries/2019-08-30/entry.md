Here is a [list of all first look games](https://boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/260703/pax-west-first-look-preview?titlesonly=1) in the Hyatt.

## [Keyforge](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/257501/keyforge-call-archons)

This was pre-pax gaming at Cafe Mox. Eric and I played a half game
with a few decks. It was an all around awful experience. Eric, being
the dueling card game master as a designer of Hearthstone had a huge
list of problems with the game. I had a smaller list but I don't think
my experience was any less terrible.

* we kept summoning cards which resulted in large confusing tableaus of
  fine print
* the pre-made decks had little visible synergy
* the games did not race towards a conclusion
* the "select a suit and play/use all cards of that suit" should have
  been interesting but when combined with the "refill hand" mechanic
  and lack of summoning cost, encouraged us to simply flop our largest
  suit every turn

I can't help but think we did something wrong. Garfield made this game
and he's not a game design idiot but when two experienced gamers can't
think of any reason to play a game a second time, then it may have
some problems. Maybe I should look for a review of someone who loves
the game.

I did like the mechanic that says: choose a suit only play or use
cards of that suit. It would be fun to make/play a game that used that
in a better way.

## [Patchwork](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/163412/patchwork)

More pre-PAX Mox fun.

The game is very well made and clever. I liked the decision on whether
to buy buttons for future earnings, low time for repeated place, or to
go for the perfect shape. The fact that you can only select the next
three pieces really cuts down on AP. I also liked the aesthetics of
setting the board up with a big ring of cloth pieces.

In spite of that I don't think
I ever need to play it again. I don't mind spacial placement games but
I don't enjoy them either.

## [Merchant's Cove](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/277700/merchants-cove)

Eric had kickstarted this and was looking forward to checking it
out. The production values were out of this world and it looked like a
fun game. The rules were terrible so it probably took us four hours to
play a game that should have taken less than an hour. They'll probably
fix this before the final release or at least immediately
post-release.

The core game is a worker placement game where you interact by adding
colored merchants to boats which eventually land at docks which
determines what kind of goods are purchased. I thought this was a
clever mechanism.

Over several turns you get a minor opportunity to influence this
merchant selection but there are power cards that can be purchased for
greater influence. Most players are better off just guessing which
merchants will win and building for that.

The key part of the game is the asymetric player powers which has
every player performing a completely different personal game to create
sellable items. While I should have liked this difference, I instead
noticed a bunch of problems.

The complexity of the powers differed wildly. The time traveler was
extremely complex while the tavern keeper was almost boring

I played the tavern keeper and it was so boring that I thought I must
be playing it wrong. The first turn it made no sense to do anything
but build beds and buy tech cards. In later turns it only made sense
to brew drinks and rearrange beds. Why have a worker placement game
where most of the worker spots have no use?

This game gets a thumbs down but I definitely think it's a gold mine
for sub-optimally implemented game mechanics.

## [Aeon's End](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/191189/aeons-end)

This is a nice co-op deck builder that I never managed to
play. Players work together to beat the boss. Figuring out who needs
to gear up and who needs a temporary buff is a neat problem. We lost
our three games so there is definitely some meat in this game (for our
group at least).

I won't get it but other folks probably will. I'd play it anytime.

## [Obsession](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/231733/obsession)

I nice little strategy game that encourages you to role-play Brittish
gentry. I got tired of that after a half hour.

The game isn't bad but adds a lot of moving parts that improve them
but detract from gameplay. A couple:

* really bad people cards that are drawn at random
* goals that you may get stuck with that have thematic (though
  unubtainable) combinations of buildings. Woe to the first time
  player that attempts to accomplish one of these.
* A long playtime for a game that doesn't seem to have too much depth

Still, I think the theme may be enough for some people.

## [Ishtar: Gardens of Babylon](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/271088/ishtar-gardens-babylon)

This is the one game I saw at PAX that I may buy.

Pluses:

* It has great aesthetics and over the course of the game you get to
  see a desert turn into a green garden.
* Very little AP
* The game has good tactics but to win you need to bet on a
  strategy. This bet is visible to other players as the "power" you
  buy.
* It appears to obsolete [Through the
  Desert](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/503/through-desert) so
  it would allow me to eliminate another game from my collection.
* multiple tile sides and arrangements makes for lots of replayability

## [Ragusa](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/253635/ragusa)

This game was a chore to learn. The board was pretty but had terrible
graphic design. I had no idea what strategy I should have been doing
until the end.

The game has an interesting placement mechanic where you place at
intersection of hexes so not only you get these actions but everyone
already on these hexes get the actions. Some good points of this:

* Rural hexes at the top are more basic, building spots in the middle
  are more complex, and vp areas at the bottom. This means the game
  naturally grows from top to bottom which is aesthetically pleasing.
* Placing on a fresh hex is making a bet on this hex. You hope other
  players will fill this up and give you free actions. Placing two
  houses on a fresh hex may be risky but in our game every spot had to
  get filled so there didn't seem to be a risk of a spot getting
  abandoned. The worst you could do is to be the last to place on a
  hex.

The two bad points of this game:

* The building seemed really unintuitive to me and I was always trying
  to figure out what I owned and what a new building costs. One player
  forgot he had an olive location until the end of the game. This is a
  minor criticism.
* The nature of the free actions means that the game gets
  exponentially longer as hexes get filled up. This can really bog
  down.

I definitely won't be buying the game but I'm up in the air about
whether I'd play it again or not.

## [Black Angel](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/230244/black-angel)

Beutiful game with absolutely terrible primary mechanics. Greedy
characters try to get victory points while the space ship is falling
apart. We could find no incentive to keep the ship together. The ship
doesn't even explode if you fail to work on it! It just drifts to the
destination planet.

We stopped playing when all the action became unusable in the first
1/3 of the game.

## [Cartographers: A Roll Player Tale](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/263918/cartographers-roll-player-tale)

A clever roll and write where players build a fantasy map while
neighbors add monsters to it. It has the spatial game that I don't
like but it was still fun. Like many roll and write games it scales to
a zillion players.

## [Gùgōn](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/250458/gugng)

Almost a heavy euro. Tough to learn but probably plays faster than I
would think. It has some interesting Chinese themes such as gift
giving and lucky numbers. I think the basic mechanic of gift giving
(worker placement of taking a card and playing a new one where you
take an action) is arbitrary enough that I don't think it should have
been bolted onto such a crunchy game. It would have been better off on
a lighter game.

Other interesting mechanics are the leeching mechanic of the great
wall and the favors of the cortesans. Having a single work on the
great wall allows a player to get a bonus every time the wall is
built. The block is never removed and does not need to be
replayed. The player who builds the wall losing his bricks but is able
to gain an advantage from these single bricks.

The game is not a buy but I would play it again.

## [Bad Bones](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/199223/bad-bones)

A very light game where skeletons attack a players castle. Several
players mentioned that moving the skeletons is fiddly and the mechanic
would work much better as a movile game.

I did like the mechanic of bouncing a skeleton to the left or right
which sent them to torment a neighbor. The catapult "fling a skeleton
to a player of your choice" was too much politics for me.

The game has a co-op mode that I haven't looked at it. I should check
it out just to see how it works. It would be interesting to have
strategies where you send particular skeltons (such as ones that came
from the top of the map) to specific players who have built their
tableau to handle them.

In any case, the fiddly-ness of this game would stop me from playing
it again.

## [Roam](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/267319/roam)

Super light game from the artist/designer of [Above and
Below](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/172818/above-and-below). I
didn't find the game compelling at all. I don't really have anything
to say about it.

## [The Shipwreck Arcana](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/220517/shipwreck-arcana)

Eric got me this. I don't like deduction games but it's light and I
may have some groups that will want to play it.

## [The Mind](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/244992/mind)

I only played one game. It's more of a psychology experiment than a
game. Everyone should play it once.

## [Plunge](https://www.plungegame.com/)

PAX has more than board games and one non-board game made my
list. Plunge is a little rogue-like game which has nice puzzles and
way-cool art. After playing the demo for ten minutes I knew I was
obligated to buy it.
